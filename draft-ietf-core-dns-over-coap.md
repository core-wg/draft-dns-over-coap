--- abstract

This document defines a protocol for sending DNS messages over the
Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). These CoAP messages are protected
by DTLS-Secured CoAP (CoAPS) or Object Security for Constrained RESTful
Environments (OSCORE) to provide encrypted DNS message exchange for
constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT).

--- middle

Introduction
============

This document defines DNS over CoAP (DoC), a protocol to send DNS
{{-dns}} queries and get DNS responses over the Constrained Application
Protocol (CoAP) {{-coap}}. Each DNS query-response pair is mapped into a
CoAP message exchange. Each CoAP message is secured by DTLS {{-dtls12}} {{-dtls13}} or
Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) {{-oscore}}
to ensure message integrity and confidentiality.

The application use case of DoC is inspired by DNS over HTTPS {{-doh}}
(DoH). DoC, however, aims for the deployment in the constrained Internet of
Things (IoT), which usually conflicts with the requirements introduced by
HTTPS.
Constrained IoT devices may be restricted in memory, power consumption,
link layer frame sizes, throughput, and latency. They may
only have a handful kilobytes of both RAM and ROM. They may sleep for long
durations of time, after which they need to refresh the named resources they
know about. Name resolution in such scenarios must take into account link
layer frame sizes of only a few hundred bytes, bit rates in the magnitute
of kilobits per second, and latencies of several seconds {{-constr-nodes}}.

To prevent TCP and HTTPS resource requirements, constrained IoT devices
could use DNS over DTLS {{-dodtls}}. In contrast to DNS over DTLS, DoC
utilizes CoAP features to mitigate drawbacks of datagram-based
communication. These features include: block-wise transfer, which solves
the Path MTU problem of DNS over DTLS (see {{-dodtls}}, section 5); CoAP
proxies, which provide an additional level of caching; re-use of data
structures for application traffic and DNS information, which saves memory
on constrained devices.

To prevent resource requirements of DTLS or TLS on top of UDP (e.g.,
introduced by DNS over QUIC {{-doq}}), DoC allows
for lightweight payload encryption based on OSCORE.

{: #fig-overview-arch title="Basic DoC architecture"}


The most important components of DoC can be seen in {{fig-overview-arch}}: A DoC
client tries to resolve DNS information by sending DNS queries carried within
CoAP requests to a DoC server.
That DoC server is a DNS client (i.e., a stub or recursive resolver) that resolves DNS information by using other DNS transports such
as DNS over UDP {{-dns}}, DNS over HTTPS {{-doh}}, or DNS over QUIC {{-doq}} when communicating with the upstream
DNS infrastructure.
Using that information, the DoC server then replies to the queries of the DoC client with DNS
responses carried within CoAP responses.

Note that this specification is disjunct from DoH since the CoRE-specific FETCH method is used.
This was done to take benefit from having the DNS query in the payload as with POST, but still
having the caching advantages we would gain with GET.
Having the DNS query in the payload means we do not need extra base64 encoding, which would increase
code complexity and message sizes.
We are also able to transfer a query block-wise.


Terminology
===========

A server that provides the service specified in this document is called a "DoC
server" to differentiate it from a classic "DNS server".
A DoC server acts either as a DNS stub resolver {{-dns-terminology}} or a DNS recursive resolver {{-dns-terminology}}.

A client using the service specified in this document to retrieve the
DNS information is called a "DoC client".

The term "constrained nodes" is used as defined in {{-constr-nodes}}.

The terms "CoAP payload" and "CoAP body" are used as defined in {{-coap-blockwise}}, Section 2.

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Selection of a DoC Server   {#sec:doc-server-selection}
=========================

While there is no path specified for the DoC resource, it is RECOMMENDED to use the root path "/"
to keep the CoAP requests small.

In this document, it is assumed that the DoC client knows the DoC server and the DNS resource at the
DoC server.
Possible options could be manual configuration of a URI {{-uri}} or CRI {{-cri}},
or automatic configuration, e.g., using a CoRE resource directory
{{-core-rd}}, DHCP or Router Advertisement options {{-dnr}} or discovery of designated resolvers
{{-ddr}}.
Automatic configuration SHOULD only be done from a trusted source.

## Discovery by Resource Type
When discovering the DNS resource through a link mechanism that allows describing a resource type
(e.g., the Resource Type Attribute in {{-core-link-format}}), the resource type "core.dns" can be
used to identify a generic DNS resolver that is available to the client.

## Discovery using SVCB Resource Records or DNR
A DoC server can also be discovered using SVCB Resource Records (RR) {{-svcb}}, {{-svcb-dns}} or DNR
Service Parameters {{-dnr}}.
{{-coap-dtls-alpn}} provides solutions to discover CoAP over (D)TLS servers using the "alpn" SvcParam.
{{-core-dnr}} provides a problem statement for service bindings discovery for OSCORE and EDHOC.
This document specifies "docpath" as
a single-valued SvcParamKey whose value MUST be a CBOR sequence of 0 or more text strings (see
{{-cbor}}), delimited by the length of the SvcParamValue field (in octets). If the
SvcParamValue ends within a CBOR text string, the SVCB RR MUST be considered as malformed.
As a text format, e.g., in DNS zone files, the CBOR diagnostic notation (see {{Section 8 of -cbor}})
of that CBOR sequence can be used.

Note, that this specifically does not surround the text string sequence with a CBOR array or a
similar CBOR data item. This path format was chosen to coincide with the path representation in CRIs
({{-cri}}). Furthermore, it is easily transferable into a sequence of CoAP Uri-Path options by
mapping the initial byte of any present CBOR text string (see {{-cbor, Section 3}}) into the Option
Delta and Option Length of the CoAP option, provided these CBOR text strings are all of a length
between 0 and 12 octets (see {{-coap, Section 3.1}}). Likewise, it can be transferred into a URI
path-abempty form (see {{-uri, Section 3.3}}) by replacing the initial byte of any present CBOR text
string with the "/" character, provided these CBOR text strings are all of a length lesser than 24
octets and do not contain bytes that need escaping.

To use the service binding from a SVCB RR, the DoC client MUST send any DoC request to the CoAP
resource identifier constructed from the SvcParams including "docpath". A rough construction
algorithm could be as follows, going through the provided records in order of their priority.

- If the "alpn" SvcParam value for the service is "coap", construct a CoAP request for CoAP over TLS,
  if it is "co", construct a CoAP request for CoAP over DTLS. Any other SvcParamKeys specifying a
  CoAP transport are out of scope of this document.
- The destination address for the request should be taken from additional information about the
  target, e.g., from an AAAA record associated to the target name or from an "ipv6hint" SvcParam
  value, or, as a fallback, by querying an address for the target name of the SVCB record.
- The destination port for the address is taken from the "port" SvcParam value, if present.
  Otherwise, take the default port of the CoAP transport.
- Set the target name of SVCB record in the URI-Host option.
- For each element in the CBOR sequence of the "docpath" SvcParam value, add a Uri-Path option to
  the request.
- If a "port" SvcParam value is provided or if a port was queried, and if either differs from
  the default port of the transport or the destination port selected above, set that port in the
  URI-Port option.
- If the request constructed this way receives a response, use the same SVCB record for construction
  of future DoC queries.
  If not, or if the endpoint becomes unreachable, repeat with the SVCB record with the next highest
  priority.

A more generalized construction algorithm can be found in {{-transport-indication}}.


Basic Message Exchange
======================

The "application/dns-message" Content-Format    {#sec:content-format}
--------------------------------------------
This document defines a CoAP Content-Format number for the Internet media type "application/dns-message" to be the mnemonic 553--based on the port assignment of DNS.
This media type is defined as in {{-doh}} Section 6, i.e., a single DNS message encoded in the DNS on-the-wire format {{-dns}}.
Both DoC client and DoC server MUST be able to parse contents in the "application/dns-message" format.

DNS Queries in CoAP Requests    {#sec:queries}
----------------------------

A DoC client encodes a single DNS query in one or more CoAP request
messages that use the CoAP FETCH {{-coap-fetch}} method.
Requests SHOULD include an Accept option to indicate the type of content that can be parsed in the response.

Since CoAP provides reliability of the message layer (e.g. CON) the retransmission mechanism of the
DNS protocol as defined in {{-dns}} is not needed.

### Request Format

When sending a CoAP request, a DoC client MUST include the DNS query in the body of the CoAP request.
As specified in {{-coap-fetch}} Section 2.3.1, the type of content of the body MUST be indicated using the Content-Format option.
This document specifies the usage of Content-Format "application/dns-message" (details see {{sec:content-format}}).
A DoC server MUST be able to parse requests of Content-Format "application/dns-message".

### Support of CoAP Caching {#sec:req-caching}

The DoC client SHOULD set the ID field of the DNS header always to 0 to enable a CoAP cache (e.g., a CoAP proxy en-route) to respond to the same DNS queries with a cache entry.
This ensures that the CoAP Cache-Key (see {{-coap-fetch}} Section 2) does not change when multiple DNS queries for the same DNS data, carried in CoAP requests, are issued.

### Examples

The following example illustrates the usage of a CoAP message to
resolve "example.org. IN AAAA" based on the URI "coaps://\[2001:db8::1\]/". The
CoAP body is encoded in "application/dns-message" Content Format.

    FETCH coaps://[2001:db8::1]/
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Accept: application/dns-message
    Payload: 00 00 01 20 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             01 00 01                                        [binary]


DNS Responses in CoAP Responses
-------------------------------

Each DNS query-response pair is mapped to a CoAP REST request-response
operation. DNS responses are provided in the body of the CoAP response.
A DoC server MUST be able to produce responses in the "application/dns-message"
Content-Format (details see {{sec:content-format}}) when requested.
A DoC client MUST understand responses in "application/dns-message" format
when it does not send an Accept option.
Any other response format than "application/dns-message" MUST be indicated with
the Content-Format option by the DoC server.

### Response Codes and Handling DNS and CoAP errors

A DNS response indicates either success or failure in the Response code of
the DNS header (see {{-dns}} Section 4.1.1). It is RECOMMENDED that
CoAP responses that carry any valid DNS response use a "2.05 Content"
response code.

CoAP responses use non-successful response codes MUST NOT contain a DNS response
and MUST only be used on errors in the CoAP layer or when a request does not
fulfill the requirements of the DoC protocol.

Communication errors with a DNS server (e.g., timeouts) SHOULD be indicated
by including a SERVFAIL DNS response in a successful CoAP response.

A DoC client might try to repeat a non-successful exchange unless otherwise prohibited.
The DoC client might also decide to repeat a non-successful exchange with a different URI, for instance, when the response indicates an unsupported Content-Format.

### Support of CoAP Caching {#sec:resp-caching}

For reliability and energy saving measures content decoupling and thus en-route caching on proxies takes a far greater role than it does, e.g., in HTTP.
Likewise, CoAP utilizes cache validation to refresh stale cache entries without large messages which regularly uses hashing over the message content for ETag generation.
As such, the approach to guarantee the same cache key for DNS responses as proposed in DoH ({{-doh}}, section 5.1) is not sufficient and needs to be updated so that the TTLs in the response are more often the same regardless of query time.

The DoC server MUST ensure that any sum of the Max-Age value of a CoAP response and any TTL in the
DNS response is less or equal to the corresponding TTL received from an upstream DNS server.
This also includes the default Max-Age value of 60 seconds (see {{-coap}}, section 5.10.5) when no Max-Age option is provided.
The DoC client MUST then add the Max-Age value of the carrying CoAP response to all TTLs in a DNS response on reception and use these calculated TTLs for the associated records.

The RECOMMENDED algorithm to assure the requirement for the DoC is to set the Max-Age option of a response to the minimum TTL of a DNS response and to subtract this value from all TTLs of that DNS response.
This prevents expired records unintentionally being served from an intermediate CoAP cache.
Additionally, it allows for the ETag value for cache validation, if it is based on the content of the response, not to change even if the TTL values are updated by an upstream DNS cache.
If only one record set per DNS response is assumed, a simplification of this algorithm is to just set all TTLs in the response to 0 and set the TTLs at the DoC client to the value of the Max-Age option.

### DNS Update {#sec:dns-update}

Until future work provides considerations for DNS Update {{-dns-update}}, a DoC server that receives a query with the UPDATE opcode SHOULD indicate in its response that it does not implement DNS Update, see {{-dns-update}}.

### Examples

The following examples illustrate the replies to the query "example.org. IN
AAAA record", recursion turned on. Successful responses carry one answer
record including address 2001:db8:1::1:2:3:4 and TTL 58719.

A successful response:

    2.05 Content
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Max-Age: 58719
    Payload: 00 00 81 a0 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
             1c 00 01 00 01 37 49 00 10 20 01 0d b8 00 01 00 [binary]
             00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04                      [binary]

When a DNS error (SERVFAIL in this case) is noted in the DNS response, the CoAP
response still indicates success:

    2.05 Content
    Content-Format: application/dns-message
    Payload: 00 00 81 a2 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
             6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01          [binary]

When an error occurs on the CoAP layer, the DoC server SHOULD respond with
an appropriate CoAP error, for instance "4.15 Unsupported Content-Format"
if the Content-Format option in the request was not set to
"application/dns-message" and the Content-Format is not otherwise supported by
the server.

CoAP/CoRE Integration
=====================

DNS Push
--------
DNS Push requires additional overhead, which conflicts with constrained resources,
This is the reason why it is RECOMMENDED to use CoAP Observe {{-coap-observe}} instead of DNS Push
in the DoC domain.

If the CoAP request indicates that the DoC client wants to observe a resource record, a DoC server
MAY use a DNS Subscribe message {{-dns-push}} instead of a classic DNS query to fetch the
information on behalf of a DoC client.
If this is not supported by the DoC server, it MUST act as if the resource were not observable.

Whenever the DoC server receives a DNS Push message {{-dns-push}} from the DNS
infrastructure for an observed resource record, the DoC server sends an appropriate Observe response
to the DoC client.

If no more DoC clients observe a resource record for which the DoC server has an open subscription,
the DoC server MUST use a DNS Unsubscribe message {{-dns-push}} to close its subscription to the
resource record as well.

OSCORE
------
It is RECOMMENDED to carry DNS messages encrypted using OSCORE {{-oscore}} between the DoC client
and the DoC server. The establishment and maintenance of the OSCORE Security Context is out of the
scope of this document.

If cache retrieval of OSCORE responses is desired, it can be achieved, for instance, by using the
method defined in {{-cachable-oscore}}. This has, however, implications on message sizes and
security properties, which are compiled in that document.

Mapping DoC to DoH
------------------
This document provides no specification how to map between DoC and DoH, e.g., at a CoAP-HTTP-proxy,
and it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Rewriting the FETCH method ({{sec:queries}}) and the TTL rewriting ({{sec:resp-caching}}) as
specified in this draft would be non-trivial.
It is RECOMMENDED to use a DNS forwarder to map between DoC and DoH, as would be the case for
mapping between any other DNS transport.

Considerations for Unencrypted Use {#sec:unencrypted-coap}
==================================
The use of DoC without a security mode of CoAP is NOT RECOMMENDED.
Without a security mode, many possible attacks need to be evaluated in the context of
the application's threat model.
This includes threats that are mitigated even by DNS over UDP:
For example, the random ID of the DNS header afford some protection against off-path cache poisoning
attacks---a threat that might be mitigated by using random large token values in the CoAP request.

Implementation Status
=====================

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol
defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in
{{-impl-status-section}}.  The description of implementations in this
section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual
implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore,
no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

According to {{-impl-status-section}}, "this will allow reviewers and
working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more
mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this information
as they see fit".

Security Considerations
=======================

General CoAP security considerations in {{Section 11 of RFC7252}} apply to DoC.
Additionally, DoC uses request patterns that require the maintenance of long-lived security
contexts.
{{Section 2.6 of -core-corrclar}} goes into more detail on what needs to be done
when those are resumed from a new endpoint.

When using unencrypted CoAP (see {{sec:unencrypted-coap}}), setting the ID of a DNS message to 0 as
specified in {{sec:req-caching}} opens the DNS cache of a DoC client to cache poisoning attacks
via response spoofing.
This document requires an unpredictable CoAP token in each DoC query from the client when CoAP is
not secured to mitigate such an attack over DoC (see {{sec:unencrypted-coap}}).

For encrypted usage with DTLS or OSCORE the impact of a fixed ID on security is limited, as both
harden against injecting spoofed responses.
Consequently, it is of little concern to leverage the benefits of CoAP caching by setting the ID to
0.

A user of DoC must be aware that the DoC server
may communicate unencrypted with the upstream DNS infrastructure, e.g., using DNS over UDP.
DoC can only guarantee confidential communication and integrity between parties for which the
security context is exchanged.
The DoC server may use another security context to communicate confidentially and with integrity
upstream (e.g., DNS over QUIC {{-doq}}) or just integrity (e.g., DNSSEC {{-dnssec}}), but, while
recommended, this is opaque to the DoC client on the protocol level.

A DoC client may not be able to perform DNSSEC validation,
e.g., due to code size constraints, or due to size of the responses.
It may trust its DoC server to perform DNSSEC validation;
how that trust is expressed is out of scope of this document.
A DoC client may be, for instance, configured to use a particular credential by which it recognizes an eligible DoC server.
That information can also imply trust in the DNSSEC validation by that server.
