1.  Introduction

   This document defines DNS over CoAP (DoC), a protocol to send DNS
   [RFC1035] queries and get DNS responses over the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].  Each DNS query-response pair
   is mapped into a CoAP message exchange.  Each CoAP message is secured
   by DTLS [RFC6347] [RFC9147] or Object Security for Constrained
   RESTful Environments (OSCORE) [RFC8613] to ensure message integrity
   and confidentiality.

   The application use case of DoC is inspired by DNS over HTTPS
   [RFC8484] (DoH).  DoC, however, aims for the deployment in the
   constrained Internet of Things (IoT), which usually conflicts with
   the requirements introduced by HTTPS.  Constrained IoT devices may be
   restricted in memory, power consumption, link layer frame sizes,
   throughput, and latency.  They may only have a handful kilobytes of
   both RAM and ROM.  They may sleep for long durations of time, after
   which they need to refresh the named resources they know about.  Name
   resolution in such scenarios must take into account link layer frame
   sizes of only a few hundred bytes, bit rates in the magnitute of
   kilobits per second, and latencies of several seconds [RFC7228].

   To prevent TCP and HTTPS resource requirements, constrained IoT
   devices could use DNS over DTLS [RFC8094].  In contrast to DNS over
   DTLS, DoC utilizes CoAP features to mitigate drawbacks of datagram-
   based communication.  These features include: block-wise transfer,
   which solves the Path MTU problem of DNS over DTLS (see [RFC8094],
   section 5); CoAP proxies, which provide an additional level of
   caching; re-use of data structures for application traffic and DNS
   information, which saves memory on constrained devices.

   To prevent resource requirements of DTLS or TLS on top of UDP (e.g.,
   introduced by DNS over QUIC [RFC9250]), DoC allows for lightweight
   payload encryption based on OSCORE.

                 . FETCH coaps://[2001:db8::1]/
                /
               /
              CoAP request
   +------+   [DNS query]   +------+   DNS query     .---------------.
   | DoC  |---------------->| DoC  |--- --- --- --->|      DNS        |
   |Client|<----------------|Server|<--- --- --- ---| Infrastructure  |
   +------+  CoAP response  +------+  DNS response   '---------------'
             [DNS response]
      \                        /\                                 /
       '-----DNS over CoAP----'  '--DNS over UDP/HTTPS/QUIC/...--'

                      Figure 1: Basic DoC architecture

   The most important components of DoC can be seen in Figure 1: A DoC
   client tries to resolve DNS information by sending DNS queries
   carried within CoAP requests to a DoC server.  That DoC server is a
   DNS client (i.e., a stub or recursive resolver) that resolves DNS
   information by using other DNS transports such as DNS over UDP
   [RFC1035], DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484], or DNS over QUIC [RFC9250] when
   communicating with the upstream DNS infrastructure.  Using that
   information, the DoC server then replies to the queries of the DoC
   client with DNS responses carried within CoAP responses.

   Note that this specification is disjunct from DoH since the CoRE-
   specific FETCH method is used.  This was done to take benefit from
   having the DNS query in the payload as with POST, but still having
   the caching advantages we would gain with GET.  Having the DNS query
   in the payload means we do not need extra base64 encoding, which
   would increase code complexity and message sizes.  We are also able
   to transfer a query block-wise.

2.  Terminology

   A server that provides the service specified in this document is
   called a "DoC server" to differentiate it from a classic "DNS
   server".  A DoC server acts either as a DNS stub resolver [RFC8499]
   or a DNS recursive resolver [RFC8499].

   A client using the service specified in this document to retrieve the
   DNS information is called a "DoC client".

   The term "constrained nodes" is used as defined in [RFC7228].

   The terms "CoAP payload" and "CoAP body" are used as defined in
   [RFC7959], Section 2.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Selection of a DoC Server

   While there is no path specified for the DoC resource, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use the root path "/" to keep the CoAP requests small.

   In this document, it is assumed that the DoC client knows the DoC
   server and the DNS resource at the DoC server.  Possible options
   could be manual configuration of a URI [RFC3986] or CRI
   [I-D.ietf-core-href], or automatic configuration, e.g., using a CoRE
   resource directory [RFC9176], DHCP or Router Advertisement options
   [RFC9463] or discovery of designated resolvers [RFC9462].  Automatic
   configuration SHOULD only be done from a trusted source.

3.1.  Discovery by Resource Type

   When discovering the DNS resource through a link mechanism that
   allows describing a resource type (e.g., the Resource Type Attribute
   in [RFC6690]), the resource type "core.dns" can be used to identify a
   generic DNS resolver that is available to the client.

3.2.  Discovery using SVCB Resource Records or DNR

   A DoC server can also be discovered using SVCB Resource Records (RR)
   [RFC9460], [RFC9461] or DNR Service Parameters [RFC9463].
   [I-D.ietf-core-coap-dtls-alpn] provides solutions to discover CoAP
   over (D)TLS servers using the "alpn" SvcParam.
   [I-D.lenders-core-dnr] provides a problem statement for service
   bindings discovery for OSCORE and EDHOC.  This document specifies
   "docpath" as a single-valued SvcParamKey whose value MUST be a CBOR
   sequence of 0 or more text strings (see [RFC8949]), delimited by the
   length of the SvcParamValue field (in octets).  If the SvcParamValue
   ends within a CBOR text string, the SVCB RR MUST be considered as
   malformed.  As a text format, e.g., in DNS zone files, the CBOR
   diagnostic notation (see Section 8 of [RFC8949]) of that CBOR
   sequence can be used.

   Note, that this specifically does not surround the text string
   sequence with a CBOR array or a similar CBOR data item.  This path
   format was chosen to coincide with the path representation in CRIs
   ([I-D.ietf-core-href]).  Furthermore, it is easily transferable into
   a sequence of CoAP Uri-Path options by mapping the initial byte of
   any present CBOR text string (see [RFC8949], Section 3) into the
   Option Delta and Option Length of the CoAP option, provided these
   CBOR text strings are all of a length between 0 and 12 octets (see
   [RFC7252], Section 3.1).  Likewise, it can be transferred into a URI
   path-abempty form (see [RFC3986], Section 3.3) by replacing the
   initial byte of any present CBOR text string with the "/" character,
   provided these CBOR text strings are all of a length lesser than 24
   octets and do not contain bytes that need escaping.

   To use the service binding from a SVCB RR, the DoC client MUST send
   any DoC request to the CoAP resource identifier constructed from the
   SvcParams including "docpath".  A rough construction algorithm could
   be as follows, going through the provided records in order of their
   priority.

   *  If the "alpn" SvcParam value for the service is "coap", construct
      a CoAP request for CoAP over TLS, if it is "co", construct a CoAP
      request for CoAP over DTLS.  Any other SvcParamKeys specifying a
      CoAP transport are out of scope of this document.

   *  The destination address for the request should be taken from
      additional information about the target, e.g., from an AAAA record
      associated to the target name or from an "ipv6hint" SvcParam
      value, or, as a fallback, by querying an address for the target
      name of the SVCB record.

   *  The destination port for the address is taken from the "port"
      SvcParam value, if present.  Otherwise, take the default port of
      the CoAP transport.

   *  Set the target name of SVCB record in the URI-Host option.

   *  For each element in the CBOR sequence of the "docpath" SvcParam
      value, add a Uri-Path option to the request.

   *  If a "port" SvcParam value is provided or if a port was queried,
      and if either differs from the default port of the transport or
      the destination port selected above, set that port in the URI-Port
      option.

   *  If the request constructed this way receives a response, use the
      same SVCB record for construction of future DoC queries.  If not,
      or if the endpoint becomes unreachable, repeat with the SVCB
      record with the next highest priority.

   A more generalized construction algorithm can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication].

4.  Basic Message Exchange

4.1.  The "application/dns-message" Content-Format

   This document defines a CoAP Content-Format number for the Internet
   media type "application/dns-message" to be the mnemonic 553--based on
   the port assignment of DNS.  This media type is defined as in
   [RFC8484] Section 6, i.e., a single DNS message encoded in the DNS
   on-the-wire format [RFC1035].  Both DoC client and DoC server MUST be
   able to parse contents in the "application/dns-message" format.

4.2.  DNS Queries in CoAP Requests

   A DoC client encodes a single DNS query in one or more CoAP request
   messages that use the CoAP FETCH [RFC8132] method.  Requests SHOULD
   include an Accept option to indicate the type of content that can be
   parsed in the response.

   Since CoAP provides reliability of the message layer (e.g.  CON) the
   retransmission mechanism of the DNS protocol as defined in [RFC1035]
   is not needed.

4.2.1.  Request Format

   When sending a CoAP request, a DoC client MUST include the DNS query
   in the body of the CoAP request.  As specified in [RFC8132]
   Section 2.3.1, the type of content of the body MUST be indicated
   using the Content-Format option.  This document specifies the usage
   of Content-Format "application/dns-message" (details see
   Section 4.1).  A DoC server MUST be able to parse requests of
   Content-Format "application/dns-message".

4.2.2.  Support of CoAP Caching

   The DoC client SHOULD set the ID field of the DNS header always to 0
   to enable a CoAP cache (e.g., a CoAP proxy en-route) to respond to
   the same DNS queries with a cache entry.  This ensures that the CoAP
   Cache-Key (see [RFC8132] Section 2) does not change when multiple DNS
   queries for the same DNS data, carried in CoAP requests, are issued.

4.2.3.  Examples

   The following example illustrates the usage of a CoAP message to
   resolve "example.org.  IN AAAA" based on the URI
   "coaps://[2001:db8::1]/".  The CoAP body is encoded in "application/
   dns-message" Content Format.

   FETCH coaps://[2001:db8::1]/
   Content-Format: application/dns-message
   Accept: application/dns-message
   Payload: 00 00 01 20 00 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
            6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
            01 00 01                                        [binary]

4.3.  DNS Responses in CoAP Responses

   Each DNS query-response pair is mapped to a CoAP REST request-
   response operation.  DNS responses are provided in the body of the
   CoAP response.  A DoC server MUST be able to produce responses in the
   "application/dns-message" Content-Format (details see Section 4.1)
   when requested.  A DoC client MUST understand responses in
   "application/dns-message" format when it does not send an Accept
   option.  Any other response format than "application/dns-message"
   MUST be indicated with the Content-Format option by the DoC server.

4.3.1.  Response Codes and Handling DNS and CoAP errors

   A DNS response indicates either success or failure in the Response
   code of the DNS header (see [RFC1035] Section 4.1.1).  It is
   RECOMMENDED that CoAP responses that carry any valid DNS response use
   a "2.05 Content" response code.

   CoAP responses use non-successful response codes MUST NOT contain a
   DNS response and MUST only be used on errors in the CoAP layer or
   when a request does not fulfill the requirements of the DoC protocol.

   Communication errors with a DNS server (e.g., timeouts) SHOULD be
   indicated by including a SERVFAIL DNS response in a successful CoAP
   response.

   A DoC client might try to repeat a non-successful exchange unless
   otherwise prohibited.  The DoC client might also decide to repeat a
   non-successful exchange with a different URI, for instance, when the
   response indicates an unsupported Content-Format.

4.3.2.  Support of CoAP Caching

   For reliability and energy saving measures content decoupling and
   thus en-route caching on proxies takes a far greater role than it
   does, e.g., in HTTP.  Likewise, CoAP utilizes cache validation to
   refresh stale cache entries without large messages which regularly
   uses hashing over the message content for ETag generation.  As such,
   the approach to guarantee the same cache key for DNS responses as
   proposed in DoH ([RFC8484], section 5.1) is not sufficient and needs
   to be updated so that the TTLs in the response are more often the
   same regardless of query time.

   The DoC server MUST ensure that any sum of the Max-Age value of a
   CoAP response and any TTL in the DNS response is less or equal to the
   corresponding TTL received from an upstream DNS server.  This also
   includes the default Max-Age value of 60 seconds (see [RFC7252],
   section 5.10.5) when no Max-Age option is provided.  The DoC client
   MUST then add the Max-Age value of the carrying CoAP response to all
   TTLs in a DNS response on reception and use these calculated TTLs for
   the associated records.

   The RECOMMENDED algorithm to assure the requirement for the DoC is to
   set the Max-Age option of a response to the minimum TTL of a DNS
   response and to subtract this value from all TTLs of that DNS
   response.  This prevents expired records unintentionally being served
   from an intermediate CoAP cache.  Additionally, it allows for the
   ETag value for cache validation, if it is based on the content of the
   response, not to change even if the TTL values are updated by an
   upstream DNS cache.  If only one record set per DNS response is
   assumed, a simplification of this algorithm is to just set all TTLs
   in the response to 0 and set the TTLs at the DoC client to the value
   of the Max-Age option.

4.3.3.  Examples

   The following examples illustrate the replies to the query
   "example.org.  IN AAAA record", recursion turned on.  Successful
   responses carry one answer record including address
   2001:db8:1::1:2:3:4 and TTL 58719.

   A successful response:

   2.05 Content
   Content-Format: application/dns-message
   Max-Age: 58719
   Payload: 00 00 81 a0 00 01 00 01 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
            6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01 c0 0c 00 [binary]
            1c 00 01 00 01 37 49 00 10 20 01 0d b8 00 01 00 [binary]
            00 00 01 00 02 00 03 00 04                      [binary]

   When a DNS error (SERVFAIL in this case) is noted in the DNS
   response, the CoAP response still indicates success:

   2.05 Content
   Content-Format: application/dns-message
   Payload: 00 00 81 a2 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61 [binary]
            6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01          [binary]

   When an error occurs on the CoAP layer, the DoC server SHOULD respond
   with an appropriate CoAP error, for instance "4.15 Unsupported
   Content-Format" if the Content-Format option in the request was not
   set to "application/dns-message" and the Content-Format is not
   otherwise supported by the server.

5.  CoAP/CoRE Integration

5.1.  DNS Push

   DNS Push requires additional overhead, which conflicts with
   constrained resources, This is the reason why it is RECOMMENDED to
   use CoAP Observe [RFC7641] instead of DNS Push in the DoC domain.

   If the CoAP request indicates that the DoC client wants to observe a
   resource record, a DoC server MAY use a DNS Subscribe message
   [RFC8765] instead of a classic DNS query to fetch the information on
   behalf of a DoC client.  If this is not supported by the DoC server,
   it MUST act as if the resource were not observable.

   Whenever the DoC server receives a DNS Push message [RFC8765] from
   the DNS infrastructure for an observed resource record, the DoC
   server sends an appropriate Observe response to the DoC client.

   If no more DoC clients observe a resource record for which the DoC
   server has an open subscription, the DoC server MUST use a DNS
   Unsubscribe message [RFC8765] to close its subscription to the
   resource record as well.

5.2.  OSCORE

   It is RECOMMENDED to carry DNS messages encrypted using OSCORE
   [RFC8613] between the DoC client and the DoC server.  The
   establishment and maintenance of the OSCORE Security Context is out
   of the scope of this document.

   If cache retrieval of OSCORE responses is desired, it can be
   achieved, for instance, by using the method defined in
   [I-D.amsuess-core-cachable-oscore].  This has, however, implications
   on message sizes and security properties, which are compiled in that
   document.

5.3.  Mapping DoC to DoH

   This document provides no specification how to map between DoC and
   DoH, e.g., at a CoAP-HTTP-proxy, and it is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   Rewriting the FETCH method (Section 4.2) and the TTL rewriting
   (Section 4.3.2) as specified in this draft would be non-trivial.  It
   is RECOMMENDED to use a DNS forwarder to map between DoC and DoH, as
   would be the case for mapping between any other DNS transport.

6.  Considerations for Unencrypted Use

   The use of DoC without a security mode of CoAP is NOT RECOMMENDED.
   Without a security mode, many possible attacks need to be evaluated
   in the context of the application's threat model.  This includes
   threats that are mitigated even by DNS over UDP: For example, the
   random ID of the DNS header afford some protection against off-path
   cache poisoning attacks---a threat that might be mitigated by using
   random large token values in the CoAP request.

7.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

7.1.  DoC Client

8.  Security Considerations

   General CoAP security considerations apply.  Exceeding those in
   Section 11 of [RFC7252], the request patterns of DoC make it likely
   that long-lived security contexts are maintained: Section 2.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-corr-clar] goes into more detail on what needs to be
   done when those are resumed from a new endpoint.

   When using unencrypted CoAP (see Section 6), setting the ID of a DNS
   message to 0 as specified in Section 4.2.2 opens the DNS cache of a
   DoC client to cache poisoning attacks via response spoofing.  This
   document requires an unpredictable CoAP token in each DoC query from
   the client when CoAP is not secured to mitigate such an attack over
   DoC (see Section 6).

   For encrypted usage with DTLS or OSCORE the impact of a fixed ID on
   security is limited, as both harden against injecting spoofed
   responses.  Consequently, it is of little concern to leverage the
   benefits of CoAP caching by setting the ID to 0.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  New "application/dns-message" Content-Format

   IANA is requested to assign CoAP Content-Format ID for the DNS
   message media type in the "CoAP Content-Formats" sub-registry, within
   the "CoRE Parameters" registry [RFC7252], corresponding to the
   "application/dns-message" media type from the "Media Types" registry
   (see [RFC8484])

   Content Type: application/dns-message

   Content Coding: -

   Id: 553 (suggested)

   Reference: [RFC8484][TBD-this-spec, Section 4.1]

9.2.  New "docpath" SVCB Service Parameter

   This document adds the following entry to the Service Parameter Keys
   (SvcParamKeys) registry in the DNS Service Bindings (SVCB) registry
   group.  The definition of this parameter can be found in Section 3.

      +================+=========+===============+=================+
      | Number         | Name    | Meaning       | Reference       |
      +================+=========+===============+=================+
      | 10 (suggested) | docpath | DNS over CoAP | [TBD-this-spec, |
      |                |         | resource path | Section 3]      |
      +----------------+---------+---------------+-----------------+

                     Table 1: Values for SvcParamKeys

9.3.  New "core.dns" Resource Type

   IANA is requested to assign a new Resource Type (rt=) Link Target
   Attribute, "core.dns" in the "Resource Type (rt=) Link Target
   Attribute Values" sub-registry, within the "CoRE Parameters" register
   [RFC6690].

   Attribute Value: core.dns

   Description: DNS over CoAP resource.

   Reference: [TBD-this-spec, Section 3]
