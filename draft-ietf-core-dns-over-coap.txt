Abstract

   This document defines a protocol for exchanging DNS messages over the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).  These CoAP messages can be
   protected by (D)TLS-Secured CoAP (CoAPS) or Object Security for
   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) to provide encrypted DNS
   message exchange for constrained devices in the Internet of Things
   (IoT).

1.  Introduction

   This document defines DNS over CoAP (DoC), a protocol to send DNS
   [RFC1035] queries and get DNS responses over the Constrained
   Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252].  Each DNS query-response pair
   is mapped into a CoAP message exchange.  Each CoAP message can be
   secured by DTLS [RFC6347] [RFC9147] or Object Security for
   Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) [RFC8613] but also TLS
   [RFC8323] [RFC8446] to ensure message integrity and confidentiality.

   The application use case of DoC is inspired by DNS over HTTPS
   [RFC8484] (DoH).  DoC, however, aims for deployment in the
   constrained Internet of Things (IoT), which usually conflicts with
   the requirements introduced by HTTPS.  Constrained IoT devices may be
   restricted in memory, power consumption, link layer frame sizes,
   throughput, and latency.  They may only have a handful kilobytes of
   both RAM and ROM.  They may sleep for long durations of time, after
   which they need to refresh the named resources they know about.  Name
   resolution in such scenarios must take into account link layer frame
   sizes of only a few hundred bytes, bit rates in the magnitude of
   kilobits per second, and latencies of several seconds [RFC7228]
   [I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis]
   // RFC Ed.: Please remove the [RFC7228] reference and replace it with
   // [I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis] throughout the document in case
   // [I-D.ietf-iotops-7228bis] becomes an RFC before publication..

   In order not to be burdened by the resource requirements of TCP and
   HTTPS, constrained IoT devices could use DNS over DTLS [RFC8094].  In
   contrast to DNS over DTLS, DoC can take advantage of CoAP features to
   mitigate drawbacks of datagram-based communication.  These features
   include: block-wise transfer [RFC7959], which solves the Path MTU
   problem of DNS over DTLS (see [RFC8094], Section 5); CoAP proxies,
   which provide an additional level of caching; re-use of data
   structures for application traffic and DNS information, which saves
   memory on constrained devices.

   To avoid the resource requirements of DTLS or TLS on top of UDP
   (e.g., introduced by DNS over DTLS [RFC8094] or DNS over QUIC
   [RFC9250]), DoC allows for lightweight message protection based on
   OSCORE.

                 . FETCH coaps://[2001:db8::1]/
                /

       '-----DNS over CoAP----'  '--DNS over UDP/HTTPS/QUIC/...--'

                      Figure 1: Basic DoC architecture

   The most important components of DoC can be seen in Figure 1: a DoC
   client tries to resolve DNS information by sending DNS queries
   carried within CoAP requests to a DoC server.  That DoC server is a
   DNS client (i.e., a stub or recursive resolver) that resolves DNS
   information by using other DNS transports such as DNS over UDP
   [RFC1035], DNS over HTTPS [RFC8484], or DNS over QUIC [RFC9250] when
   communicating with the upstream DNS infrastructure.  Using that
   information, the DoC server then replies to the queries of the DoC
   client with DNS responses carried within CoAP responses.

   Note that this specification is distinct from DoH, since the CoAP-
   specific FETCH method [RFC8132] is used.  This has the benefit of
   having the DNS query in the body as when using the POST method, but
   still with the same caching advantages of responses to requests that
   use the GET method.  Having the DNS query in the body means that we
   do not need extra base64 encoding, which would increase code
   complexity and message sizes.  Also, this allows for the block-wise
   transfer of queries [RFC7959].

2.  Terminology and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   A server that provides the service specified in this document is
   called a "DoC server" to differentiate it from a classic "DNS
   server".  A DoC server acts either as a DNS stub resolver or a DNS
   recursive resolver [BCP219].  As such, the DoC server communicates
   with an "upstream DNS infrastructure" or a single "upstream DNS
   server".  A "DoC resource" is a CoAP resource [RFC7252] at the DoC
   server that DoC clients can target to send a DNS query in a CoAP
   request.

   A client using the service specified in this document to retrieve the
   DNS information is called a "DoC client".

   The term "constrained nodes" is used as defined in [RFC7228].
   [RFC6690] describes that "Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE)"
   realize the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture
   [REST] in a suitable form for such constrained nodes.

   The terms "payload" and "body" are used as defined in [RFC7959],
   Section 2.  Note that, when block-wise transfer is not used, the
   terms "payload" and "body" are to be understood as equal.

   For better readability, in the examples in this document the binary
   payload and resource records are shown in a hexadecimal
   representation as well as a human-readable format.  In the actual
   message sent and received, however, they are encoded in the binary
   message format defined in [RFC1035].

3.  Selection of a DoC Server

   While there is no path specified for the DoC resource, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use the root path "/" to keep the CoAP requests small.

   The DoC client needs to know the DoC server and the DoC resource at
   the DoC server.  Possible options to assure this could be manual
   configuration of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [RFC3986] or
   Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) [I-D.ietf-core-href], or
   automatic configuration, e.g., using a CoRE resource directory
   [RFC9176], DHCP or Router Advertisement options [RFC9463], or
   discovery of designated resolvers [RFC9462].  Automatic configuration
   SHOULD only be done from a trusted source.

3.1.  Discovery by Resource Type

   For discovery of the DoC resource through a link mechanism that
   allows describing a resource type (e.g., the Resource Type attribute
   in [RFC6690]), this document introduces the resource type "core.dns".
   It can be used to identify a generic DNS resolver that is available
   to the client.

3.2.  Discovery using SVCB Resource Records or DNR

   A DoC server can also be discovered using Service Binding (SVCB)
   Resource Records (RR) [RFC9460] [RFC9461] or Discovery of Network-
   designated Resolvers (DNR) Service Parameters [RFC9463].  [RFC8323]
   defines the Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ID for CoAP
   over TLS servers and [I-D.ietf-core-coap-dtls-alpn] defines the ALPN
   ID for CoAP over DTLS servers.  Because the ALPN extension is only
   defined for (D)TLS, these mechanisms cannot be used for DoC servers
   which use only OSCORE [RFC8613] and Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman Over
   COSE (EDHOC) [RFC9528] (with COSE abbreviating "Concise Binary Object
   Notation (CBOR) Object Signing and Encryption" [RFC9052]) for
   security.  Specifying an alternate discovery mechanism is out of
   scope of this specification.  [I-D.lenders-core-dnr] provides further
   exploration of the challenges here.

   This document is not an SVCB mapping document for the CoAP schemes as
   defined in Section 2.4.3 of [RFC9460].  A full SVCB mapping is being
   prepared in [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication], generalizing
   mechanisms that are introduced in this document for discovery of DoC.

   This document specifies "docpath" as a single-valued SvcParamKey that
   is mandatory for DoC SVCB records.  If the "docpath" SvcParamKey is
   absent, the service should not be considered a valid DoC service.

   The docpath is devided up into segments of the absolute path to the
   DoC resource (docpath-segment), each a sequence of 1-255 octets.  In
   ABNF [RFC5234]:

   docpath-segment = 1*255OCTET

   Note that this restricts the length of each docpath-segment to at
   most 255 octets.  Paths with longer segments cannot be advertised
   with the "docpath" SvcParam and are thus NOT RECOMMENDED for the path
   to the DoC resource.

   The presentation format value of "docpath" SHALL be a comma-separated
   list (Appendix A.1 of [RFC9460]) of 0 or more docpath-segments.  The
   root path "/" is represented by 0 docpath-segments, i.e., an empty
   list.  The same considerations for the "," and "" characters in
   docpath-segments for zone-file implementations as for the alpn-ids in
   an "alpn" SvcParam MAY apply (Section 7.1.1 of [RFC9460]).

   The wire-format value for "docpath" consists of 0 or more sequences
   of octets prefixed by their respective length as a single octet.  We
   call this single octets the length octet.  The length octet and the
   corresponding sequence form a length-value pair.  These length-value
   pairs are concatenated to form the SvcParamValue.  These pairs MUST
   exactly fill the SvcParamValue; otherwise, the SvcParamValue is
   malformed.  Each such length-value pair represents one segment of the
   absolute path to the DoC resource.  The root path "/" is represented
   by 0 length-value pairs, i.e., SvcParamValue length 0.

   Note that this format uses the same encoding as the "alpn" SvcParam
   and can reuse the decoders and encoders for that SvcParam with the
   adaption that a length of zero is allowed.  As long as each docpath-
   segment is of length 0 and 24 octets, it is easily transferred into
   the path representation in CRIs [I-D.ietf-core-href] by masking each
   length octet with the CBOR text string major type 3 (0x60 as an
   octet, see [RFC8949]).  Furthermore, it is easily transferable into a
   sequence of CoAP Uri-Path options by mapping each length octet into
   the Option Delta and Option Length of the corresponding CoAP Uri-Path
   option, provided the docpath-segments are all of a length between 0
   and 12 octets (see [RFC7252], Section 3.1).  Likewise, it can be
   transferred into a URI path-abempty form by replacing each length
   octet with the "/" character None of the abovementioned prevent
   longer docpath-segments than the considered, they just make the
   translation harder, as they require to make space for the longer
   delimiters, in turn requiring to move octets.

   To use the service binding from an SVCB RR, the DoC client MUST send
   a DoC request constructed from the SvcParams including "docpath".
   The construction algorithm for DoC requests is as follows, going
   through the provided records in order of their priority.

   *  If the "alpn" SvcParam value for the service is "coap", a CoAP
      request for CoAP over TLS MUST be constructed.  If it is "co", a
      CoAP request for CoAP over DTLS MUST be constructed.  Any other
      SvcParamKeys specifying a transport are out of the scope of this
      document.

   *  The destination address for the request SHOULD be taken from
      additional information about the target, e.g., from an AAAA record
      associated with the target name or from an "ipv6hint" SvcParam
      value.  As a fallback, an address MAY be queried for the target
      name of the SVCB record.

   *  The destination port for the request MUST be taken from the "port"
      SvcParam value, if present.  Otherwise, take the default port of
      the CoAP transport, e.g., with regards to this specification TCP
      port 5684 for "coap" or UDP port 5684 for "co".  This document
      introduces no limitations on the ports that can be used.  If a
      malicious SVCB record allows its originator to influence message
      payloads, Section 12 of [RFC9460] recommends placing such
      restrictions in the SVCB mapping document.  The records used in
      this document only infuence the Uri-Path option.  That option is
      only sent in the plaintext of an encrytped (D)TLS channel, and
      thus does not warrant any limitations.

   *  The request URI's hostname component MUST be the Authentication
      Domain Name (ADN) when obtained through DNR and MUST be the target
      name of the SVCB record when obtained through a _dns query (if
      AliasMode is used, to the target name of the AliasMode record).
      This can be achieved efficiently by setting that name in TLS
      Server Name Indication (SNI) [RFC8446], or by setting the Uri-Host
      option on each request.

   *  For each element in the CBOR sequence of the "docpath" SvcParam
      value, a Uri-Path option MUST be added to the request.

   *  If the request constructed this way receives a response, the same
      SVCB record MUST be used for construction of future DoC queries.
      If not, or if the endpoint becomes unreachable, the algorithm
      SHOULD be repeated with the SVCB record with the next highest
      priority.

   A more generalized construction algorithm for any CoAP request can be
   found in [I-D.ietf-core-transport-indication].

3.2.1.  Examples


   // RFC Ed.: Since the number for "docpath" was not assigned at the
   // time of writing, we used the hex ff 0a (in decimal 65290; from the
   // private use range of SvcParamKeys) throughout this section.
   // Before publication, please replace ff 0a with the hexadecimal
   // representation of the final value assigned by IANA in this
   // section.

   A typical SVCB resource record response for a DoC server at the root
   path "/" of the server looks like the following (the "docpath"
   SvcParam is the last 4 bytes ff 0a 00 00 in the binary):

   Resource record (binary):
     04 5f 64 6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72
     67 00 00 40 00 01 00 00 06 28 00 1e 00 01 03 64
     6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00
     01 00 03 02 63 6f ff 0a 00 00

   Resource record (human-readable):
     _dns.example.org.  1576  IN SVCB 1 dns.example.org (
         alpn=co docpath )

   The root path is RECOMMENDED but not required.  Here are two examples
   where the "docpath" represents paths of varying depth.  First, "/dns"
   is provided in the following example (the last 8 bytes ff 0a 00 04 03
   64 6e 73):

   Resource record (binary):
     04 5f 64 6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72
     67 00 00 40 00 01 00 00 00 55 00 22 00 01 03 64
     6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00
     01 00 03 02 63 6f ff 0a 00 04 03 64 6e 73

   Resource record (human-readable):
     _dns.example.org.    85  IN SVCB 1 dns.example.org (
         alpn=co docpath=dns )

   Second, an examples for the path "/n/s" (the last 8 bytes ff 0a 00 04
   01 6e 01 73):

   Resource record (binary):
     04 5f 64 6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72
     67 00 00 40 00 01 00 00 06 6b 00 22 00 01 03 64
     6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00
     01 00 03 02 63 6f ff 0a 00 04 01 6e 01 73

   Resource record (human-readable):
     _dns.example.org.   643  IN SVCB 1 dns.example.org (
         alpn=co docpath=n,s )

   If the server also provides DNS over HTTPS, "dohpath" and "docpath"
   MAY co-exist:

   Resource record (binary):
     04 5f 64 6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72
     67 00 00 40 00 01 00 00 01 ad 00 2b 00 01 03 64
     6e 73 07 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00
     01 00 06 02 68 33 02 63 6f 00 07 00 07 2f 7b 3f
     64 6e 73 7d ff 0a 00 00

   Resource record (human-readable):
     _dns.example.org.   429  IN SVCB 1 dns.example.org (

4.1.  The "application/dns-message" Content-Format

   This document defines a CoAP Content-Format identifier for the
   Internet media type "application/dns-message" to be the mnemonic 553
   — based on the port assignment of DNS.  This media type is defined as
   in Section 6 of [RFC8484], i.e., a single DNS message encoded in the
   DNS on-the-wire format [RFC1035].  Both DoC client and DoC server
   MUST be able to parse contents in the "application/dns-message"
   Content-Format.  For the purposes of this document, only OPCODE 0
   (Query) is supported for DNS messages.  Future work might provide
   specifications and considerations for other values of OPCODE.  Unless
   another error takes precedence, a DoC server uses RCODE = 4, NotImp
   [RFC1035], in its response to a query with an OPCODE that it does not
   implement (see also Section 4.3.3).

4.2.  DNS Queries in CoAP Requests

   A DoC client encodes a single DNS query in one or more CoAP request
   messages that use the CoAP FETCH [RFC8132] request method.  Requests
   SHOULD include an Accept option to indicate the type of content that
   can be parsed in the response.

   Since CoAP provides reliability at the message layer (e.g., through
   Confirmable messages) the retransmission mechanism of the DNS
   protocol as defined in [RFC1035] is not needed.

4.2.1.  Request Format

   When sending a CoAP request, a DoC client MUST include the DNS query
   in the body of the CoAP request.  As specified in Section 2.3.1 of
   [RFC8132], the type of content of the body MUST be indicated using
   the Content-Format option.  This document specifies the usage of
   Content-Format "application/dns-message" (for details, see
   Section 4.1).  A DoC server MUST be able to parse requests of
   Content-Format "application/dns-message".

4.2.2.  Support of CoAP Caching

   The DoC client SHOULD set the ID field of the DNS header to 0 to
   enable a CoAP cache (e.g., a CoAP proxy en-route) to respond to the
   same DNS queries with a cache entry.  This ensures that the CoAP
   Cache-Key (see [RFC8132], Section 2) does not change when multiple
   DNS queries for the same DNS data, carried in CoAP requests, are
   issued.  Apart from losing these caching benefits, there is no harm
   it not setting it to 0, e.g., when the query was received from
   somewhere else.  In any instance, a DoC server MUST copy the ID from
   the query in its response to that query.

4.2.3.  Examples

   The following example illustrates the usage of a CoAP message to
   resolve "example.org.  IN AAAA" based on the URI
   "coaps://[2001:db8::1]/".  The CoAP body is encoded in the
   "application/dns-message" Content-Format.

   FETCH coaps://[2001:db8::1]/
   Content-Format: 553 (application/dns-message)
   Accept: 553 (application/dns-message)
   Payload (binary):
     00 00 01 20 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 65 78 61
     6d 70 6c 65 03 6f 72 67 00 00 1c 00 01

   Payload (human-readable):
     ;; ->>Header<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 0
     ;; flags: rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ARCOUNT: 0

     ;; QUESTION SECTION:
     ;example.org.             IN      AAAA

4.3.  DNS Responses in CoAP Responses

   Each DNS query-response pair is mapped to a CoAP request-response
   operation.  DNS responses are provided in the body of the CoAP
   response, i.e., it is also possible to transfer them using block-wise
   transfer [RFC7959].  A DoC server MUST be able to produce responses
   in the "application/dns-message" Content-Format (for details, see
   Section 4.1) when requested.  A DoC client MUST be able to understand
   responses in the "application/dns-message" Content-Format when it
   does not send an Accept option.  Any response Content-Format other
   than "application/dns-message" MUST be indicated with the Content-
   Format option by the DoC server.

4.3.1.  Response Codes and Handling DNS and CoAP errors

   A DNS response indicates either success or failure in the RCODE of
   the DNS header (see Section 4.1.1 of [RFC1035]).  It is RECOMMENDED
   that CoAP responses that carry a parseable DNS response use a 2.05
   (Content) response code.

   CoAP responses using non-successful response codes MUST NOT contain a
   DNS response and MUST only be used for errors in the CoAP layer or
   when a request does not fulfill the requirements of the DoC protocol.

   Communication errors with an upstream DNS server (e.g., timeouts)
   MUST be indicated by including a DNS response with the appropriate
   RCODE in a successful CoAP response, i.e., using a 2.xx response
   code.  When an error occurs at the CoAP layer, e.g., if an unexpected
   request method or an unsupported Content-Format in the request are
   used, the DoC server SHOULD respond with an appropriate CoAP error.

   A DoC client might try to repeat a non-successful exchange unless
   otherwise prohibited.  The DoC client might also decide to repeat a
   non-successful exchange with a different URI, for instance, when the
   response indicates an unsupported Content-Format.

4.3.2.  Support of CoAP Caching

   For reliability and energy saving measures, content decoupling (such
   as en-route caching on proxies) takes a far greater role than it does
   in HTTP.  Likewise, CoAP makes it possible to use cache validation to
   refresh stale cache entries to reduce the number of large response
   messages.  For cache validation, CoAP implementations regularly use
   hashing over the message content for ETag generation (see [RFC7252],
   Section 5.10.6).  As such, the approach to guarantee the same cache
   key for DNS responses as proposed in DoH ([RFC8484], Section 5.1) is
   not sufficient and needs to be updated so that the TTLs in the
   response are more often the same regardless of query time.

   The DoC server MUST ensure that the sum of the Max-Age value of a
   CoAP response and any TTL in the DNS response is less than or equal
   to the corresponding TTL received from an upstream DNS server.  This
   also includes the default Max-Age value of 60 seconds (see
   Section 5.10.5 of [RFC7252]) when no Max-Age option is provided.  The
   DoC client MUST then add the Max-Age value of the carrying CoAP
   response to all TTLs in a DNS response on reception and use these
   calculated TTLs for the associated records.

   The RECOMMENDED algorithm for a DoC server to meet the requirement
   for DoC is as follows: Set the Max-Age option of a response to the
   minimum TTL of a DNS response and subtract this value from all TTLs
   of that DNS response.  This prevents expired records unintentionally
   being served from an intermediate CoAP cache.  Additionally, if the
   ETag for cache validation is based on the content of the response, it
   allows that ETag not to change.  This then remains the case even if
   the TTL values are updated by an upstream DNS cache.  If only one
   record set per DNS response is assumed, a simplification of this
   algorithm is to just set all TTLs in the response to 0 and set the
   TTLs at the DoC client to the value of the Max-Age option.

   If shorter caching periods are plausible, e.g., if the RCODE of the
   message indicates an error that should only be cached for a minimal
   duration, the value for the Max-Age option SHOULD be set accordingly.
   This value might be 0, but if the DoC server knows that the error
   will persist, greater values are also conceivable, depending on the
   projected duration of the error.  The same applies for DNS responses
   that for any reason do not carry any records with a TTL.

4.3.3.  Examples

   The following example illustrates the response to the query
   "example.org.  IN AAAA record", with recursion turned on.  Successful
   responses carry one answer record including address
   2001:db8:1:0:1:2:3:4 and TTL 79689.

   A successful response:

   2.05 Content
   Content-Format: 553 (application/dns-message)
   Max-Age: 58719
   Payload (human-readable):
     ;; ->>Header<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 0
     ;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ARCOUNT: 0

     ;; QUESTION SECTION:
     ;example.org.                 IN      AAAA
     ;; ANSWER SECTION:
     ;example.org.         79689   IN      AAAA    2001:db8:1:0:1:2:3:4

   When a DNS error – NxDomain (RCODE = 3) for "does.not.exist" in this
   case – is noted in the DNS response, the CoAP response still
   indicates success.

  2.05 Content
  Content-Format: 553 (application/dns-message)
  Payload (human-readable):
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 0
    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

    ;; QUESTION SECTION:
    ;does.not.exist.              IN      AAAA

   As described in Section 4.1, a DoC server uses NotImp (RCODE = 4) if
   it does not support an OPCODE—a DNS Update (OPCODE = 5) for
   "example.org" in this case.

   2.05 Content
   Content-Format: 553 (application/dns-message)
   Payload (human-readable):
     ;; ->>Header<<- opcode: UPDATE, status: NOTIMP, id: 0
     ;; flags: qr ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ARCOUNT: 0

     ;; QUERY SECTION:
     ;example.org.                 IN      AAAA

   When an error occurs at the CoAP layer, the DoC server responds with
   an appropriate CoAP error, for instance 4.15 (Unsupported Content-
   Format) if the Content-Format option in the request was not set to
   "application/dns-message" and the Content-Format is not otherwise
   supported by the server.

   4.15 Unsupported Content-Format
   [no payload]

5.  Interaction with other CoAP and CoRE Features

5.1.  DNS Push Notifications and CoAP Observe

   DNS Push Notifications [RFC8765] provides the capability to
   asynchronously notify clients about resource record changes.
   However, it results in additional overhead, which conflicts with
   constrained resources.  This is the reason why it is RECOMMENDED to
   use CoAP Observe [RFC7641] instead of DNS Push in the DoC domain.
   The DoC server SHOULD provide Observe capabilities on its DoC
   resource and do as follows.

   If the CoAP request indicates that the DoC client wants to observe a
   resource record, a DoC server MAY use a DNS Subscribe message instead
   of a classic DNS query to fetch the information on behalf of a DoC
   client.  If this is not supported by the DoC server, it MUST act as
   if the DoC resource were not observable.

   Whenever the DoC server receives a DNS Push message from the DNS
   infrastructure for an observed resource record, the DoC server sends
   an appropriate Observe notification response to the DoC client.

   If no more DoC clients observe a resource record for which the DoC
   server has an open subscription, the DoC server MUST use a DNS
   Unsubscribe message to close its subscription to the resource record
   as well.

   A DoC server can still provide Observe capabilities to its DoC
   resource without providing this proxying to DNS Push, e.g., if it
   receives new information on a record through other means.

5.2.  OSCORE

   It is RECOMMENDED to carry DNS messages protected using OSCORE
   [RFC8613] between the DoC client and the DoC server.  The
   establishment and maintenance of the OSCORE Security Context is out
   of the scope of this document.

   [I-D.amsuess-core-cachable-oscore] describes a method to allow cache
   retrieval of OSCORE responses and discusses the corresponding
   implications on message sizes and security properties.

5.3.  Mapping DoC to DoH

   This document provides no specification on how to map between DoC and
   DoH, e.g., at a CoAP-to-HTTP-proxy.  In fact, such a direct mapping
   is NOT RECOMMENDED: rewriting the FETCH method (Section 4.2) and the
   TTL rewriting (Section 4.3.2) as specified in this draft would be
   non-trivial.  It is RECOMMENDED to use a DNS forwarder to map between
   DoC and DoH, as would be the case for mapping between any other pair
   of DNS transports.

6.  Considerations for Unprotected Use

   The use of DoC without confidentiality and integrity protection is
   NOT RECOMMENDED.  Without secure communication, many possible attacks
   need to be evaluated in the context of the application's threat
   model.  This includes known threats for unprotected DNS [RFC3833]
   [RFC9076] and CoAP Section 11 of [RFC7252].  While DoC does not use
   the random ID of the DNS header (see Section 4.2.2), equivalent
   protection against off-path poisoning attacks is achieved by using
   random large token values for unprotected CoAP requests.  If a DoC
   message is unprotected it MUST use a random token of at least 2 bytes
   length to mitigate this kind of poisoning attacks.

7.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   General CoAP security considerations ([RFC7252], Section 11) apply to
   DoC.  DoC also inherits the security considerations of the protocols
   used for secure communication, e.g., OSCORE ([RFC8613], Section 12)
   or DTLS ([RFC6347], Section 5 and [RFC9147], Section 11).
   Additionally, DoC uses request patterns that require the maintenance
   of long-lived security contexts.  Section 2.6 of
   [I-D.ietf-core-corr-clar] provides insights on what can be done when
   those are resumed from a new endpoint.

   Though DTLS v1.2 [RFC6347] was obsoleteted by DTLS v1.3 [RFC9147]
   there are still many CoAP implementations that still use v1.2 at the
   time of writing.  As such, this document also accounts for the usage
   of DTLS v1.2 even though newer versions are RECOMMENDED when using
   DTLS to secure CoAP.

   When using unprotected CoAP (see Section 6), setting the ID of a DNS
   message to 0 as specified in Section 4.2.2 opens the DNS cache of a
   DoC client to cache poisoning attacks via response spoofing.  This
   document requires an unpredictable CoAP token in each DoC query from
   the client when CoAP is not secured to mitigate such an attack over
   DoC (see Section 6).

   For secure communication via DTLS or OSCORE, the impact of a fixed ID
   on security is limited, as both harden against injecting spoofed
   responses.  Consequently, the ID of the DNS message can be set to 0
   without any concern in order to leverage the advantages of CoAP
   caching.

   A DoC client must be aware that the DoC server may communicate
   unprotected with the upstream DNS infrastructure, e.g., using DNS
   over UDP.  DoC can only guarantee confidentiality and integrity of
   communication between parties for which the security context is
   exchanged.  The DoC server may use another security context to
   communicate upstream with both confidentiality and integrity (e.g.,
   DNS over QUIC [RFC9250]), but, while recommended, this is opaque to
   the DoC client on the protocol level.  Record integrity can also be
   ensured upstream using, e.g., DNSSEC [RFC9364].

   A DoC client may not be able to perform DNSSEC validation, e.g., due
   to code size constraints, or due to the size of the responses.  It
   may trust its DoC server to perform DNSSEC validation; how that trust
   is expressed is out of the scope of this document.  For instance, a
   DoC client may be, configured to use a particular credential by which
   it recognizes an eligible DoC server.  That information can also
   imply trust in the DNSSEC validation by that server.
